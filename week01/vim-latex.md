## Installation

The hard way:
- Make sure you have latex installed first
- Download the latest version of vim-latex at [http://sourceforge.net/projects/vim-latex/files/snapshots/](http://sourceforge.net/projects/vim-latex/files/snapshots/)
- Extract the archives into your ```~/.vim``` folder.

The easy way (hopefully)
- Add this to your .vimrc ```Bundle 'git://git.code.sf.net/p/vim-latex/vim-latex'```
